## 💡 Recommendations

### For MarKE (Entry)
> Pre-flash before peeking Long A doors. Your dry peeks cost 2 rounds.

### For Gabe (Support)
> Stay within 800 units of teammates. Your isolated deaths at B were all tradeable if positioned correctly.

### For H0NeST (Lurker)
> Sync lurk timing with team execute. You're arriving 3-5 seconds late on flanks.
