### 🎮 DEMO PLAYER EDITION

Major release introducing standalone demo playback without CS2 installed.

### Added
- **Demo Player** (`src/player/`) — Visual demo playback with Pygame
  - `python main.py play <demo.dem>` — New CLI command
  - Controls: Space (pause), ←/→ (seek), ↑/↓ (rounds), +/- (speed), 1-9 (jump)
  - Player dots with team colors (CT=blue, T=orange)
  - Kill feed with weapon/headshot indicators
  - HUD with round info, progress bar, tick counter
  - Grid fallback when radar images unavailable

- **Dynamic Tickrate** — Read from demo header (`playback_ticks / playback_time`)
  - Supports 64-tick (MM) and 128-tick (Faceit)
  - No more hardcoded assumptions

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - O(log n) tick lookup via `np.searchsorted` on pre-built index
  - LRU cache (OrderedDict) with 500-entry limit and proper eviction
  - Frame skipping at high playback speeds
  - Delta-time clamped (MAX_DT=0.1) to prevent jumps on focus loss

- **Safe Seek** — Bounds checking + snap to nearest valid tick

### Changed
- **CLI Architecture** — Subcommands: `play`, `analyze`, `check-parsers`
- **ParsedDemo** — Added `tickrate` field to dataclass

### Dependencies
- Added `pygame>=2.5.0`
